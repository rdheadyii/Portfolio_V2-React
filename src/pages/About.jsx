            I have a Bachelor's degree which I used for 4 years and have decided to make a career change to pursue my next endeavors in the field of software development. Computers have always been my passion, when working with computers I do not feel it is a job but more of a hobby. When engaging in software development, I gain a sense of euphoria. Software development is a rapidly growing field, with a plethora of opportunities within multiple realms of businesses. I am confident that I have the abilities and commitment to be a positive asset in the software development field . I look forward to the opportunities the future holds for me.
